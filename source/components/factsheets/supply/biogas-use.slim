h1 Use of local biogas

p The local supply of biogas is determined by the userâ€™s choices for the waste sector. This lever determines whether that biogas is used to generate electricity (as is currently the case at the Southern Landfill) or used directly in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors (assuming it can be fed into the gas distribution network). 

h2 Option A

p 100% of the local biogas supply is used for electricity generation.

h2 Option B

p From 2020, 50% of local biogas supply is used for electricity generation and the remainder replaces other natural gas use.

h2 Option C
From 2020, 100% of local biogas supply is used for non-electricity purposes and replaces natural gas use.
