h1 Active transport

p In 2012, the share of passenger-kilometres travelled by walking and cycling in Wellington are estimated at 2.2% and 0.8% respectively. 

h2 Level 1

Level 1 assumes that walking and cycling mode shares stay at current levels to 2050.

h2 Level 2

Level 2 assumes that cycling mode share increases to 1.5% by 2050, while walking mode share stays at its current level.

h2 Level 3

Level 3 assumes that cycling mode share increases to 2.5-2.8% by 2050, while walking mode share stays at its current level.

h2 Level 4

Level 4 assumes that cycling mode share increases to 4-5% and walking mode share increases to 3% by 2050.

h2 Interaction with other choices

p Walking and cycling are competition not only with private car trips but also with public transport. To try to capture this, cycling mode share decreases slightly if higher levels are chosen on the public transport lever (and vice versa). The low ends of the ranges stated here correspond to Level 4 on public transport, and the high ends correspond to Level 1. We assume negligible impact on walking.
