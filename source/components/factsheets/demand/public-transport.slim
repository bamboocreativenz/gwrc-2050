h1 Public transport

p In 2012, the share of passenger-kilometres travelled by bus and train in Wellington are estimated at 3.8% and 4.5%.  

h2 Level 1

Level 1 assumes that bus and train mode shares stay at current levels to 2050.

h2 Level 2

p Level 2 assumes that bus mode share increases to 7-8% by 2050, while train mode share stays at current levels. 

h2 Level 3

p Level 3 assumes that bus mode share increases to 9-10% and train mode share increases to 8% by 2050.

h2 Level 4

p Level 4 assumes that bus mode share increases to 12-13% and train mode share increases to 10% by 2050.

h2 Interaction with other choices

p Public transport is in competition not only with private car trips but also with walking and cycling. To try to capture this, bus mode share decreases slightly if higher levels are chosen on the active transport lever (and vice versa). The low ends of the ranges stated here correspond to Level 4 on active transport, and the high ends correspond to Level 1. We assume negligible impact on train travel.
