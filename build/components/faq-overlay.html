Excess electricity supply will not help achieve an 80% cut.</p></div></section></article><article data-bind="faq"><header><h5>Why can't I hit the 80% target?</h5></header><section class="js-content-wrapper"><div class="js-content"><p>You must reduce energy demand and decarbonise energy supply - so make sure you change both demand and supply levers. Have you electrified transport, heat or industry? If not, these sectors will be consuming fossil fuels and could stop you from meeting the target. Despite big increases in electricity use, liquid fuel, such as biofuel, will still be needed in 2050. So take a look at the 'flow' view to make sure you have enough low carbon liquid fuel.</p></div></section></article><article data-bind="faq"><header><h5>Where do the figures come from?</h5></header><section class="js-content-wrapper"><div class="js-content"><p>The data behind the calculator is rooted in scientific and engineering realities, looking at what is thought to be physically and technically possible in each sector. To do this, a broad range of experts were consulted from inside and outside government.</p></div></section></article><article data-bind="faq"><header><h5>Why do the graph views show that demand is lower than supply?</h5></header><section class="js-content-wrapper"><div class="js-content"><p>Some of the energy supply creates wasted energy - or a 'loss' - when converted from one format to another (such as when generating electricity). So supply will always have to exceed the total energy demand. Take a look at the 'flow' view to see where these losses come from.</p></div></section></article></div></div>
