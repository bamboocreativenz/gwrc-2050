<h1>Freight Mode & Efficiency</h1><p>In 2012, the share of Wellington’s freight volume (in tonne-kilometres) moved by road is estimated at 86%, with the remaining 14% moved by rail. Note that this excludes sea freight, which is treated separately.</p><h2>Level 1</h2><p>Level 1 assumes that the share of freight moved by road increases to 88%, with rail decreasing to 12%. The energy required per tonne-kilometre is reduced by 7% by 2050.</p><h2>Level 2</h2><p>Level 2 assumes that the share of freight moved by road decreases to 84%, with rail increasing to 16%. The energy required per tonne-kilometre is reduced by 27% by 2050.</p><h2>Level 3</h2><p>Level 3 assumes that the share of freight moved by road decreases to 82%, with rail increasing to 18%. The energy required per tonne-kilometre is reduced by 37% by 2050.</p><h2>Level 4</h2><p>Level 4 assumes that the share of freight moved by road decreases to 75%, with rail increasing to 25%. The energy required per tonne-kilometre is reduced by 45% by 2050, and all rail freight is electrified by 2025.</p><h2>Interaction with other choices</h2><p>The total movement of goods by road and rail is set with the ‘freight volume’ lever. Sea freight is included in the marine transport sector, as we assume it is not in direct competition with road and rail in Wellington’s location. Biofuels can be chosen as a supply option.</p><figure><img class="aligncenter" alt="Freight Mode &amp; Efficiency" src="/images/factsheets/freight-mode-and-efficiency-img.png" /><figcaption>Energy demand for road & rail freight, assuming Level 1 on mode & efficiency (GWh/yr).</figcaption></figure>
