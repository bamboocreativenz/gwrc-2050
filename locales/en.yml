      Government targets require us to reduce emissions to 20% of 1990 levels."

  guide:
    '1': "The UK is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050, relative to 1990 levels.


      To do this we must decarbonise the UK economy while ensuring secure and affordable energy supplies."

    '2': "How should this be done? The 2050 Calculator lets you take control and create your own energy pathway for the country.


      The calculator allows you to consider the choices and trade-offs we face. It covers all parts of the economy and all greenhouse gas emissions released in the UK."

    '3': "The calculator models what is thought to be physically and technically possible in forty-two different sectors. It is based on scientific and engineering data and was built in collaboration with a wide range of organisations from inside and outside of government.


      The model, all its assumptions and the code for this interface are all available open source.

    '4': "### Let's get started...

      The purpose of the calculator is to build an energy pathway for the UK that hits the 80% CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction target at the top of the page. As you get closer to achieving this the arrow will move to the right."

    '5': "The sliders represent each sector of the UK energy system. Moving the sliders allows you to cut emissions by adjusting the level of change for energy demand, supply and other factors such as storage. Use the \"Demand\", \"Supply\" and \"Other\" tabs to toggle between the different groups of sliders.


      To use a slider, select a number from 1 (minimal effort) to 4 (pushes limits of what is technically feasible).  When the choice is A to D, this describes different scenarios rather than changes in effort.


      For more information on each sector simply click the <span class=\"info-button\"></span> icon."

    '6': "As the sliders are adjusted your progress towards achieving the 80% target is updated. At the same time, the picture near the top of the screen changes to reflect the choices you’ve made.


      There are eight ways to see the impact of your choices, which include: supply and demand of energy and electricity, total emissions, energy flows, area of land required, impact on air quality, energy security and cost."

    '7': "If you experience any problems creating a pathway that achieves an 80% cut in emissions it’s worth considering the following factors:


<em>You need to reduce energy demand and decarbonise energy supply</em>


<em>Have you electrified transport, heat or industry? If not, these sectors will be consuming fossil fuels.</em>


<em>Look at the ‘Electricity’ tab – are you oversupplying electricity? Excess electricity supply will not help achieve an 80% cut.</em>


<em>Despite big increases in electricity use, liquid fuel, such as bioenergy, will still be needed in 2050.</em>"

    '8': "There are many different ways to create a pathway that hits the 80% target. To see some example pathways go to the menu button on the top left of the page and click on \"Example Pathways\"."

    '9': "Once you've hit the target use the \"Finish & Share\" button for an overview of your pathway results and share with friends and colleagues."

          not: "This tool does not model the hourly, daily or even seasonal operation of the electricity grid. It presents annual averages. Therefore it does not correctly represent the peaks and troughs of electricity demand.


            To go some way to addressing this flaw, the tool applies a simulated stress test to your pathway of five cold, almost windless, days. This is described in more detail here.
            In this case, the stress test implies that <span data-bind=\"text: peak\"></span>GW of additional peaking plant may be required for supply to meet demand over that period.


            You can influence the amount of peaking plant by changing your choice level of 'storage, demand shifting & interconnection' below right, or by reducing the amount of intermittent renewable generation, or by reducing the demand for electricity"

          known: "<span data-bind=\"text: auto\"></span>GW of conventional gas electricity generation plant has been assumed to have been built by 2050, to cover the gap between average electricity demand and the amount of low carbon generation selected in this pathway."

  faqs:
    q1:
      question: "How does the calculator work?"
      answer: "For a re-cap of the introduction slides click <a href=\"/#/home\">here</a>."
    q2:
      question: "Why won't the emissions change when I move the supply sliders?"
      answer: "Take a look at the 'Electricity' tab. Are you oversupplying electricity? Excess electricity supply will not help achieve an 80% cut."
    q3:
      question: "Why can't I hit the 80% target?"
      answer: "You must reduce energy demand and decarbonise energy supply - so make sure you change both demand and supply levers. Have you electrified transport, heat or industry? If not, these sectors will be consuming fossil fuels and could stop you from meeting the target. Despite big increases in electricity use, liquid fuel, such as biofuel, will still be needed in 2050. So take a look at the 'flow' view to make sure you have enough low carbon liquid fuel."
    q4:
      question: "What does the dynamic landscape do?"
      answer: "As you make changes to each slider, the image will change to reflect the decision you take. For example, if you increase the level of offshore wind, more turbines at sea will appear."
    q5:
      question: "Where do the figures come from?"
      answer: "The data behind the calculator is rooted in scientific and engineering realities, looking at what is thought to be physically and technically possible in each sector. To do this, a broad range of experts were consulted from inside and outside government. For more background on the calculator go to: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/2050-pathways-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.gov.uk/2050-pathways-analysis</a>."
    q6:
      question: "Why do the graph views show that demand is lower than supply?"
      answer: "Some of the energy supply creates wasted energy - or a 'loss' - when converted from one format to another (such as when generating electricity). So supply will always have to exceed the total energy demand. Take a look at the 'flow' view to see where these losses come from."


  share:
    congratulate: "Congratulations on completing your pathway!"
    body: "These three charts summarise your choices for the demand and supply options you have selected and – crucially – the impact on emissions. The landscape above provides a visual overview of the changes you’ve made.


Hopefully the calculator has highlighted the scale of the challenge – and the range of options available – to decarbonise the way we use energy.


Please share your pathway with others to help build interest in the future of energy in the UK.
